# diskops

Parsimoniously recursive delete, and copy and others are not in core Clojure at the time of writing.  Furthermore it is kind of difficult to track down _the_ library to use without importing a load of baggage, so here, unceremoniously, and forever to be minimal and simple are some functions we all need.

- delete-directory (including nested directories)
- copy-recursive (its in the name)

Enjoy!
